[TOC]

**CoreFlow** is a modern, high-performance graph execution runtime designed for AI, ML, and computer vision applications. Our platform combines:

- **üîó No-code Graph Builder**: Visual, intuitive UI to build pipelines with automatic optimization
- **ü§ñ Cross-platform Support**: Seamless deployment across ARM or x86 with unified APIs.
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Optimized determinstic execution for real-time processing across CPU, GPU, and specialized hardware
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Friendly**: Simple C++ API with comprehensive error handling
- **üîß Extensible**: Easy to add custom kernels and processing behaviors

## üîß Architecture

### Graph-Based Execution
CoreFlow uses a graph-based execution model where:
- **Graphs** represent execution modeled as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
- **Nodes** represent processing operations
- **Edges** define data flow between operations
- **Kernels** define a runnable operation or algorithm
- **Targets** define a collection of suppported operations

### Built-in AI/ML Support
- **ONNX Runtime**: Deploy models using Open Neural Network Exchange
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Leverage Google's on-device AI framework
- **Executorch**: Leverage Meta's on-device AI framework
- **Model Management**: Easy model loading and switching

### Performance Features
- **Memory Management**: Automatic memory optimization
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CPU, GPU, and specialized hardware support
- **Streaming and Pipelining Support**: Automatic graph runtime optimization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
